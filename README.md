</h1>

Register Screen is a project made alongside my course in [B7Web](https://b7web.com.br/fullstack/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMI-7eYj5vT-QIVEz6RCh2VfgXQEAAYASAAEgJfifD_BwE&ref=I24108426I) in order to practice HTML (form element and different types of inputs) and CSS (did a nice animation using keyframes).

## See Register Screen in action

- Download all files and open the [index.html]https://github.com/valmarath/tela-de-registro/blob/main/register.html) file on your browser. 

- To test the responsive features, you can use the inspect option to change the dimensions as you please and see how it responds.
